I imagine that, aside from Sona's classical musician career and her being a part of Pentakill (and an ex DJ too), she takes part in other musical projects, for example Red Dead Chilli Peppers with Karthus (a specific Karthus written by Aren, but if your Karthus wants to play along then be my guest!).

I enjoy holding Hunger Games via [BrantSteele's Hunger Games Simulator](https://brantsteele.net/hungergames/disclaimer.php) once in a while, it's fun.

I'm even keeping stats in a google doc. Yes... I know... I know. I am unwell.
