So, hey. You can call me Chibi, Sona’s writer, or whatever the hell.

## Character

Yes, that's literally just Sona League of Legends.
I’ve been RPing the character since 2016, yet still mostly unfamiliar with League verse/gameplay.

I’m mostly roleplaying classic Sona and Pentakill Sona. Heavily leaning towards Pentakill Sona as of late, because a) I love metal \m/, and b) I like her menacing vibe which is such a fun contrast from classic Sona’s gentleness. 
I do love writing the classic/defaukt Sona too; she lives in my heart and in my head rent free. Be nice to her.

One thing to remember: *she's not a telepath*. Parentheses text means she's speaking to you via sign language or writing/typing or any other available communication mediums. She also knows Morse code, or whatever is the version of it called on Runeterra. 


## Account

Anyways. Both serious & crack RP take place (mostly crack, though). Lots of shitposts, low effort edits (and high effort edits). Occasional doodles, too. (or commissions!)
Art will be credited unless it’s mine - please don’t steal my stuff! And no, I won’t draw for free unless it’s on a whim or something.

English isn’t my first language so pardon the occasional mistakes. Also, please don’t hesitate to bump me via like or DMs if I missed a reply on our thread. I don't normally drop threads but I /will/ let you know if I want to drop it, promise! Communication is key, folks. I suck at planning and plotting but it doesn't mean I'm not willing to try. 
Shipping: could take place. Multiship, kinda sorta. I’m not a minor but this is a smut-free zone. No, not even in DMs.

Also: I may be very active for some time and then disappear for months, for various reasons, really (from “too busy” to “no muse/energy to write”). Please don’t get mad, folks.

Anyways, that’s it; see you in my mentions! Adios!
