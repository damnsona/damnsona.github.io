[SOLO] Aches

Mentioning: Karthus, Kayle, Sett & a few others

# I.

It started weeks ago. Perhaps around the day she bit into Sett's deep fried sponge, maybe later. But it's been happening approximately since then.

First, it were just random heartbeat increases, flushed skin and such. Sometimes even adrenalin kicking in, senses going overboard. Restlessness, too.

Initially Sona blamed it on the sponge, but in all honesty, she's eaten (and drank) worse during some of her tours. This wasn't that.

It's gotten worse since the New Year. Sometimes the pain was unbearable, making it hard to breathe; sometimes all she wanted to do was to curl up on the bed and not go anywhere.

Weirdest part was that she'd find herself thinking about Sett. Not like her best friend wasn't on her mind before the last few minutes of the past year. He would always be there, but now... Now it was a little too much, up to the point when she couldn't even focus on her daily tasks. Even on the music, on the vital part of her life. Etwahl would comfort her, yet she found herself thinking...overthinking, even.

Still, she wouldn't tell anyone about what happened that day. Not to Kayle, or Phel, or even Rakan.
No one could know. No one will ever know.

And yet, it was hard to keep hiding her condition. One day Sona broke in front of Kayle when they were chilling without the boys. She ended up cried into the angel's shoulder, yet even then she didn't tell her anything, other than:

(It hurts. Right here.) A fist was placed over her heart.

"That bad, huh? I'm no medic, but I think you should see someone about it."

(Maybe I should,) she handsigned in response, then got up to get a glass of water. She was giving up at this point.

"Skip the hair day then? We'll take ya there tomorrow. And no, I'm not taking 'no' for an answer, I'm just tired of seeing you so unfocused because you're ill and not telling us."


## II.

A large, black monster truck was quite an overwhelming presence on the road; there were two long-haired individuals inside and an angel in the back. Karthus was at the wheel, and Kayle was in the bed of the truck; playing the acoustic guitar as she sat outside, letting the wind flow through her wings.

“Nervous?” The deathsinger asked, not really expecting an answer from Sona; his eyes had to be on the road. He did get a response, though; the sound of a fake text-to-speech voice was unexpected, startling Karthus for a moment.

(I'm scared of hearing that I'm terminally ill or something,) said the voice, reading what she typed in. Karthus glanced at the keyboardist, who was staring out of the window, forehead pressed against the cold glass, while also holding her phone up, speaker pointed in his direction.

"Sona... Whatever it is, you got this. You’re a tough cookie, like Kayle usually says. Just follow what they tell you to do, alright?" They pulled up in the parking lot of the hospital; Kayle hopped out from the back of the truck and helped Sona get out of the car. Sona was largely unamused by that move, not wanting to be treated like a dying patient. Kayle ignored her face expression and still held on to Sona's elbow. "We'll pick you up at 4, yeah?" She asked.

(Yes. Enjoy the hair salon visit, guys. Thank you,) she typed, cracking a smile. They arrived on time; she still had some time to kill before her visit to the physician's office.

Door 483, a kind elderly woman was waiting for Sona there, welcoming the musician with a warm smile. She didn't speak sign language, so Sona had to communicate with writing and other basic cues. So far, everything has been going smoothly: Sona started with explaining the basics by typing them out onto the screen of her tablet. A little physical examination was in order: listening to her heart and breathing, measuring her temperature and blood pressure, questions about her chronic diseases, life habits and diet, stress levels (Sona was having a hard time with that question), et cetera. After those were done, the doctor finally gave her first verdict:
"What can I say, miss… You look quite healthy at first glance, but also very tired. Have you been sleeping well?"

Sona shook her head no.

"And that's strike one, miss, you should get your daily eight hours. Your body is not a battery, you can not just make up for the sleep you lost over the week by spending the entire weekend in bed. Last question, do you drink enough water?"

Sona pulled up a large water bottle that was in her bag. She cracked a smile; the feeling in her chest turned warm for a moment. She remembered the reminder given to her by a certain someone: no less than two liters; three on yoga days. She pointed at the bottle, then signed a "2".

"Good. Alright, we will need to perform some tests, I'll refer you to a cardiologist first of all, and then some blood tests tomorrow–." The doctor heard Sona’s stomach rumble. "Or maybe today. You haven’t eaten yet, have you?"

Again, Sona shook her head no.

"In that case, you may take the blood tests today, and then you have to eat. We have a lot of work to do, and I need you to have all the energy, dear." The doctor smiled as she spotted a happy glint in Sona’s eyes at the mention of food. "Good appetite, I see, I see. I'll print the referral for you; I'm sure we can do all the examinations within one day: your heart, possible respiratory issues, and also do an MRI. Which means that these must be taken off," she said, pointing at the piercings in Sona's ears and brow. "All of it. No metals for MRI, you should know that. And no, it’s not a Pentakill pun, dear."

### III.

The hospital’s canteen was spacious enough for Sona to find a table far away from other people where she could enjoy the meal in peace. The food looked bland. Poor girl had to ask for extra salt and pepper: her food habits included way spicier stuff, and the lady at the canteen gave her a stern look for it; it’s almost as the doctor told them specifically not to serve extra seasoning to the girl with magenta hair. She sighed and dug into her food.

...Gods damn it. After so many hours of fasting before examinations, the meal turned out to be pretty darn alright, even without the seasoning. Maybe the bland food has its charm...sometimes. She's starting to understand the big guy.

Speaking of him...

Sona looked at their last text conversation; it was a couple days ago and he left her on read. Sona sighed, clutching her chest for a moment. She really wanted to check on him but she also didn’t want to be a bother... All she wanted to know was whether he was doing alright.

Maybe she should ask Phel.

Maybe.

It was time to finish the meal; she still had half an hour before the upcoming tests, but she wanted to digest the breakfast and...maybe lay down somewhere, literally anywhere. The burning sensation in her chest was back, and she needed to brave the storm somehow.

### IV.

It felt somewhat jarring, to lay in the MRI machine, like she was a one-episode-only character of one of those TV shows where they’re checking the patient to find out what kind of bizarre condition they were in.

"...And we're done here. You can get dressed. Your physician will tell you everything," the nurse said as she helped Sona get up.

(Is there anything serious?) She wrote in the notepad provided to her.

"Nothing serious. You're completely healthy, miss - at least according to what the scan shows us."

(Strange,) Sona thought to herself. She dressed up and picked up her bag and papers, exchanged a few written words with the personnel, then headed back outside. Kayle was already waiting in the parking lot.

"Well? You good?"

(More or less,) she replied in signs. (Wake me up as early as possible.)

"As early as possible, huh? Because they told you to call them as early as possible, or because you're dying to know what’s up with your test results?"

(The latter,) she replied in signs, then continued by texting. (I don't even know if I'll be able to sleep tonight. The call with the doctor is at 10 a.m.)

"Do you want me to knock you out?"

Sona shook her head no. Kayle laughed; she was clearly joking but Sona was too bothered by her health to even notice that it was a joke. The angel approached her and gave her a brief embrace before ushering her to the vehicle. 

"Come on, let's go. We'll spike yer tea with some sleeping pills and you'll be snoring in no time. I'll wake you up, don't worry. By the way, how do you like my hair?"

### V.

Sona woke up at 9:30 when Yorick knocked on her door.

"Kayle told me to wake you up," the bassist said as Sona opened the door for him. She stood in the doorway in her black pyjamas, clenching her phone in a tight grip, with a displeased mien. "I know you wanted to wake up earlier but she decided you needed more sleep."

(Where is she?)

Yorick read her hand signs, then replied. “She left with Morde earlier. I’m pretty sure she just didn’t want to see you get angry at her, but I’m just asking you to understa–” Yorick got interrupted by a door being suddenly closed into his face. “...Oh, well. I did my part.”

Sona closed the door with a silent huff, then marched straight to her desk where her laptop sat, with the intention to check the test results in the system. Water bottle in one hand, mouse in another, she looked over them real quick; overall, it all looked...fine.

Which was odd. She was expecting some abnormalities, anything pointing at an ailment.

Well... At least the pain wasn’t bothering her right now, which was a relief. The keyboardist sighed and decided to go for a quick rinse in the shower to make herself look more presentable before the videochat with the doctor.

Once out of the shower, she started the videocall. Fingers hovered over the keyboard as she was ready to start typing as soon as the physician hops into the call. Which she did, seconds after Sona.

“Good morning, miss. How are you feeling today?”

(Good morning. I’m alright, I guess. I wanted to ask... Those are my tests, right? I mean, MY tests, not anyone else’s?) She anxiously typed into the chat box; the noises from the keyboard were a consistent, quick rattle as she tapped against them with haste, all fingers in motion.

"Yes, those are your tests." At that information, Sona tilted her head, but continued to listen. "Overall, you are in good health, which is great: all tests showed perfect results. The only exception is, however, an increased amount of cortisol. Nothing near dangerous, but I have to ask you again: just how stressful is your day-to-day life? I know it varies from person to person, but I'd like you to rate it yourself."

(Like I said, not so much.) She thought for a moment, then typed more. (Though, I admit, on some days I feel rather anxious, but I have a hard time pinpointing the cause.)

“...Have you considered therapy?”

(But I’m fine!)

“You never know, dear. I heavily suggest you find a therapist and work with them to find what’s troubling you. At the very least, you could rely on your friends or your fiancé for some moral support. People who know you may offer insight that no specialist can.”

Sona blinked. Fingers began clicking on the keyboard faster than usual. (Pardon me for swaying off the topic, but I have to ask: did you say fiancé? If there are rumors, I have to know. I’m not seeing anyone and I want to prevent a scandal.)

“My apologies, dear, I just saw your ring and...” The doctor trailed off. “In any case, miss, I will write out my recommendations for you later. You are doing great, but you should take better care of your mental well-being.”

Sona just nodded, clutching her chest once more. Half the words flew past her head; the mention of the ring brought the pain back. How could such sweet memories be laced with so much hurt..? She couldn't understand.

But she also vowed to herself that she will never talk to anyone about what happened on New Year's. 

The physician kept speaking, while Sona was taking deep breaths, gaze unfocused. It took her about half a minute to come back to her senses.

“...Sona, I'm asking you this not just as your medical service provider but also as someone who genuinely cares about your well-being: please consider seeing a therapist or at least reading some self-help articles online if you're scared. Alright? Could you do that for me?”

(I will try. Thank you.) With anxiety coursing through her, Sona clasped her hands together, tightly entwining her fingers. That full-body checkup wasn’t really for nothing, but it didn’t give her any answers either. Just more questions, really.

As soon as the call was over, Sona closed the laptop and stood up. She was starving, and her mind was now fully set on making breakfast...before a message suddenly popped up on her screen, accompanied by a unique notification sound that only this contact had.

The pain in her chest instantly vanished, while her heart rate increased way above the norm again. Waaaay above the norm.

Well... Breakfast could wait, she thought. A message from her best friend was important, even if it's just a silly meme.
