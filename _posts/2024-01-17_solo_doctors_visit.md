A large, black monster truck was quite an overwhelming presence on the road, and there was an angel at the wheel. Karthus has kindly agreed to drive Sona to the planned doctor’s visit. Kayle was in the bed of the truck; she wasn’t there for anything in particular other than keeping them company, playing the acoustic guitar as she sat outside, letting the wind flow through her wings.

“Nervous?” The deathsinger asked, not really expecting an answer from Sona; his eyes had to be on the road. He did get a response, though; the sound of a fake text-to-speech voice was quite unexpected, startling Karthus for a moment.

(I need to know what’s going on with me but I’m scared of hearing that I’m terminally ill or something,) said the voice, reading what she typed in. Karthus glanced at the keyboardist, who was staring out of the window, forehead pressed against the cold glass, while also holding her phone up, speaker pointed in his direction.

“Sona… Whatever it is, you got this. You’re a tough cookie, like Kayle usually says. Just follow what they tell you to do, alright?” They pulled up in the parking lot of the hospital; Kayle hopped out from the back of the truck and helped Sona get out of the car. Sona was largely unamused by that move, not wanting to be treated like a dying patient. Kayle ignored her face expression and still held on to Sona’s elbow. “We’ll pick you up at 4, yeah?” She asked.

(Yes. Enjoy the hair salon visit, guys. Thank you,) she typed, cracking a smile. They arrived on time; she still had some time to kill before her visit to the physician’s office.

Door 483, a kind elderly woman was waiting for Sona there, welcoming the musician with a warm smile. She didn’t speak sign language, only understanding “thank you”, so Sona had to communicate with writing and other basic cues. So far, everything has been going smoothly: Sona started with explaining the basics by typing them out onto the screen of her tablet.
The problem was seemingly simple: for a few weeks, she had been suffering from chest pains: quite an unpleasant feeling, on the edge of sickness; not sharp but dull, almost burning. Not constant, but sometimes pretty strong, and sometimes not present at all.

A little physical examination was in order: listening to her heart and breathing, measuring her temperature and blood pressure, questions about her chronic diseases, life habits and diet, et cetera. After those were done, the doctor finally gave her first verdict:
“What can I say, miss… You look quite healthy at first glance, but also very tired. Have you been sleeping well?”

Sona shook her head no.

“And that’s the first strike. You should get your daily eight hours. Your body is not a battery, you can not just make up for the sleep you lost over the week by spending the entire weekend in bed. Do you drink enough water?”

Sona pulled up a water bottle. She cracked a smile; the feeling in her chest turned warm for a moment. She remembered the reminder given to her: no less than two liters; three on yoga days.

(2L a day,) she wrote. (At least that’s how much I try to drink.)

“That’s good. We will need to perform some tests, I’ll refer you to a cardiologist first of all, and then some blood tests tomorrow–.” The doctor heard Sona’s stomach rumble. “Or maybe today. You haven’t eaten yet, have you?”

Again, Sona shook her head no.

“In that case, you may take the blood tests today, then we check you for digestive issues–”

Sona frowned.

“Yes, miss, we have to do that, especially since you mentioned how you like extra spicy food and fast food. Even if it isn’t connected to your current problem, it would be good to know if there are any other potential issues, wouldn’t it?”

A defeated sigh escaped the musician’s lips. She nodded, not really in a position to argue.

“Good. We do that, and then you have to eat. We have a lot of work to do, and I need you to have all the energy, dear.” The doctor smiled as she spotted a happy glint in Sona’s eyes at the mention of food. “Good appetite, I see, I see. I’ll print the directions, I’m sure we can do it all within one day. After breakfast, we do the electrocardiogram; we want to make sure your heart is in good condition. Then, we need to examine you for respiratory issues, and also do an MRI. Which means that these must be taken off,” she said, pointing at the piercings on Sona’s ears and brow. “All of it. No metals for MRI, you should know that. And no, it’s not a Pentakill pun, dear.”

The hospital’s canteen was large, and the food looked…bland. Sona had to ask for extra salt and pepper: her food habits included way spicier stuff, and the lady at the canteen gave her a stern look for it; it’s almost as the doctor told them specifically not to serve extra seasoning to the girl with pink hair. She sighed and dug into her food.

Gods damn it. After so many hours of being hungry, it was…pretty damn alright. Maybe the bland food has its charm. Maybe the big guy is right.

Sona looked at their last text conversation; it was a couple days ago and he left her on read. She didn’t want to be a bother, although she couldn’t help but wonder how he’s doing.

Maybe she should ask Phel.

Maybe.

It was time to finish the meal; she still had half an hour before the next tests but she wanted to digest this and…maybe lay down somewhere, literally anywhere. The burn was back, and she needed to brave the storm somehow.

The MRI scan was the last one.
It felt somewhat jarring, to lay in the MRI machine, like she was a one-time character of one of those medical shows where they’re checking the patient to find out what strange condition they were in.

“You can get back to your physician, they’ll tell you everything,” the young assistant said as she helped Sona get up.

(What do you mean? Is there anything serious?) She asked in sign language, mouthing the words along.

“Nothing serious. You’re completely healthy, miss - at least according to the MRI.”

(Strange,) Sona thought to herself. She dressed up and picked up her bag and papers, exchanged a few (written) words with the personnel, then headed back outside.

Kayle was already waiting in the parking lot.

“You good, Red?”
(More or less,) she replied in signs. (Wake me up as early as possible.)
“As early as possible, huh? Because they told you to come as early as possible, or because you’re dying to know what’s up with your test results before your 10 a.m. call with the doctor?”
(The latter,) she replied. (I don’t even know if I’ll be able to sleep tonight.)
“Do you want me to knock you out?”
Sona shook her head no. Kayle laughed; she was clearly joking but Sona was too bothered by her health to even notice that it was a joke. The angel approached her and gave her a brief embrace before ushering her to the vehicle. “Come on, let’s go. We’ll spike yer tea with some sleeping pills and you’ll be snoring in no time. I’ll wake you up, don’t worry.”

Sona woke up at 9:30 when Yorick knocked on her door.

“Kayle told me to wake you up,” the bassist said as Sona opened the door for him. She was standing in the doorway in her jammies, clenching her phone in a tight grip, a mix of angry and confused. “I know you wanted to wake up earlier but we decided you need more sleep.”

(Where is she?)

Yorick read her hand signs, then replied. “She left with Morde earlier. I’m pretty sure she just didn’t want to see you get angry at her, but I’m just asking you to understa–” Yorick got interrupted by a door being closed almost into his face. “...Oh, well. I did my part.”

Sona closed the door and went straight to her laptop to check if the test results arrived. She looked over them real quick, and overall, it seemed…fine.

Which was odd.

At least the pain wasn’t here right now; that was a relief. The keyboardist went for a quick shower to make herself look more presentable before the chat with the doctor.

She started the videocall. Fingers hovered over the keyboard as she was ready to start typing when the physician hops into the call. Which she did, seconds after Sona.

“Good morning, miss. How are you feeling today?”

(Good morning. I’m… I slept surprisingly long today, mostly thanks to my friends. I wanted to ask… Those are my tests, right? I mean, MY tests, not anyone else’s?) She typed into the chat box hastily; the noises from the keyboard were a consistent, quick rattle as she typed.

“Yes, yes, those are your tests. Overall, you are in good health, which is great. EKG was fine, ultrasound was also fine, nothing in the MRT… Your blood tests were generally also fine, however, show an increased amount of cortisol. Nothing near dangerous, but I have to ask again: how stressful is your day to day life?”

(Not so much…) She thought for a moment, then typed more. (Though, I admit, on some days I feel rather anxious, but I have a hard time pinpointing the cause.)

“Anxiety can cause the physical discomfort too. Have you considered therapy?”

(But I’m fine!)

“You never know, dear, but I heavily suggest you find a therapist and find what’s troubling you. At the very least, you could rely on your friends or your fiance for some moral support.”

Sona blinked. Fingers began clicking on the keyboard faster than usual. (Excuse me for swaying off the topic, but I have to ask: did you say fiance? If there are rumors, I have to know. I’m not seeing anyone and I want to prevent a scandal.)

“My apologies, dear, I just saw the ring and…” The doctor trailed off. “In any case, miss, I will write out my recommendations for you later. You are doing great, but you should take better care of your mental well-being.”

Sona just nodded, clutching her chest once more. Half the words flew past her head; the mention of the ring brought the pain back. How could such sweet memories be laced with so much hurt..?

The physician kept speaking, and Sona was taking deep breaths, gaze unfocused. It took her about half a minute to come back to her senses.

“Miss? I ask you not just as someone who you’re paying for medical services, but also as a person who cares for another person: please, start seeing a therapist. Or at least try those self-help courses online, see how you can find what’s bothering you, and solve that issue before it gets worse. Alright? Could you do that for me?”

(I will try. Thank you.) Sona clasped her hands together, squeezing her fingers tightly. That visit wasn’t really for nothing, but it didn’t give her any answers either.

As soon as the call was over, a message from Sett suddenly popped up on her screen. The pain vanished, yet her heart rate increased way above the norm again.

Everything could wait, she thought. A message from the best friend, this was important.
