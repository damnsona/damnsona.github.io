So, hey. You can call me Chibi, Sona's writer, or whatever the hell.

I'm mostly roleplaying classic Sona and Pentakill Sona. Heavily leaning towards PK Sona as of later, because a) I love metal, and b) I like her menacing vibe which is such a fun contrast from classic Sona's gentleness. 
(Although the classic one lives in my heart and I absolutely adore her & writing as her!)
I've been RPing the character since 2016, yet still mostly unfamiliar with League verse/gameplay.

So, portrayal stuff. First things first: she's not a telepath. Parentheses text means sign language or writing/typing. She also knows Morse code, or whatever is the version of it called on Runeterra.
Second: I may be very active for some time and then disappear for months, for various reasons, really (from "too busy" to "no muse/energy to write"). Please don't get mad, folks.

Anyways. Both serious & crack RP take place (mostly crack, though). Lots of shitposts. Occasional doodles, too.
Art will be credited unless it's mine - yes, I draw sometimes, please don't steal my stuff! And no, I won't draw for free unless it's on a whim.

English isn't my first language so pardon the occasional mistakes.
Also, please don't hesitate to bump me via like or DMs if I missed a reply on our thread. I'll let you know if I want to drop it, promise!
Shipping: could take place. Multiship, kimda.
I'm not a minor but this is a smut-free zone. No, not even in DMs.

Anyways, that's it; see you in my mentions! Adios!
