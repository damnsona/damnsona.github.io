So, hey. You can call me Chibi.

Mostly roleplaying classic Sona and Pentakill Sona. Heavily leaning towards PK Sona because I just like her menacing vibe (although the classic one lives in my heart and I absolutely adore her & writing with her).

First things first: she's not a telepath. Parentheses text means sign language or writing/typing.

I've been RPing the character since 2016, yet still mostly unfamiliar with League verse/gameplay.
Both serious & crack RP take place (mostly crack, though). Lots of shitposts. Occasional doodles, too.
Art will be credited unless it's mine - yes, I draw sometimes, please don't steal my stuff! And no, I won't draw for free unless it's on a whim.

English isn't my first language so pardon the occasional mistakes.
Also, please don't hesitate to bump me via like or DMs if I missed a reply on our thread. I'll let you know if I want to drop it, promise!
I'm not a minor but this is a smut-free zone. No, not even in DMs.

Anyways, that's it; see you in my mentions! Adios!
