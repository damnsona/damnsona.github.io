So, hey. You can call me Chibi, Sona’s writer, or whatever the hell.
If you came here from anywhere that isn't my Twitter, then [@DAMNSONA](https://twitter.com/DAMNSONA) is where you should've originally been, just saying.

## Character

Yes, that's literally just Sona from League of Legends.
I’ve been RPing the character since 2016, yet familiarizing myself with League verse lore and gameplay.

I’m mostly writing as classic Sona and Pentakill Sona.
Heavily (no pun intended) leaning towards Pentakill Sona as of late, because a) I love metal and the band shenanigans \m/, b) I like musicverse in general, and c) I like her menacing vibe which is such a fun contrast from classic Sona’s gentleness.
I do love writing the classic/default Sona too; she lives in my heart and in my head rent free. Be nice to her. Buy her cake. Listen to her play, tell her how you like her music.

One thing to remember: *she's not a telepath*. Parentheses text means she's speaking to you via sign language or writing/typing or any other available communication mediums. She also knows Morse code, or whatever is the version of it called on Runeterra. 
There's an unsorted headcanon thread [here](https://twitter.com/DAMNSONA/status/1732753873721295122).

## Account

Both serious & crack RP take place (mostly crack, though). I do love a lengthy, serious thread, though.
...and, yes, I prefer threads to quote RP, sue me.

Anyways! Fair warning, there'll be lots of shitposts, low effort edits (and high effort edits). Occasional doodles, too. (or commissions that I bought from other artists!)
Art will be credited unless it’s mine - please don’t steal my stuff! And no, I won’t draw for free unless it’s on a whim or something.

English isn’t my first language so pardon the occasional mistakes.

Also, please don’t hesitate to bump me via like or DMs if I missed a reply on our thread that you wish to continue writing. Communication is key, folks. I suck at planning and plotting but it doesn't mean I'm not willing to try~!
Shipping: could take place. Multiship, kinda sorta. I’m not a minor but this is a smut-free zone. No, not even in DMs.

Also: I may be very active for some time and then disappear for months, for various reasons, really (from “too busy” to “no muse/energy to write”). Please don’t get mad, folks.

Anyways, that’s it; see you in my mentions! Adios!
